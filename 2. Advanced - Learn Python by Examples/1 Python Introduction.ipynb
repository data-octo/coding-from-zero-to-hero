Fun is a great motivator, and since you'll be able to build prototypes and tools quickly with Python, many find coding in Python a satisfying experience. Thus, Python has gained popularity for being a beginner-friendly language, and it has replaced Java as the¬†most popular introductory language at Top U.S. Universities.\n","\n","**Easy to Understand**\n","\n","Being a very high level language, Python reads like English, which takes a lot of syntax-learning stress off coding beginners. Python handles a lot of complexity for you, so it is very beginner-friendly in that it allows beginners to focus on learning programming concepts and not have to worry about too much details.\n","\n","**Very Flexible**\n","\n","As a dynamically typed language, Python is really flexible. This means there are no hard rules on how to build features, and you'll have more flexibility solving problems using different methods (though the Python philosophy encourages using the obvious way to solve things). Furthermore, Python is also more forgiving of errors, so you'll still be able to compile and run your program until you hit the problematic part.\n","\n","**Beginner Friendly**\n","\n","There are dozens of programming languages, and many of them are good for a wide variety of projects. But¬†Python is unique in that it‚Äôs easy to understand, even for a beginner. Some languages use a perplexing combination of symbols and abbreviations. Python doesn‚Äôt.\n","\n","**Kids Won‚Äôt Outgrow Python**\n","\n","A few programming languages designed for beginners are purely graphical. These are called ‚Äúblock‚Äù languages. Scratch is an example of a block programming language. Although¬†Scratch is good for really young learners, it‚Äôs easy to outgrow.\n","\n","That‚Äôs not the case with Python, which powers the world‚Äôs second-largest search engine: YouTube.¬†Scientists use Python to work with large data sets, and software engineers build neural networks and other forms of artificial intelligence with this versatile language.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## What can we do with Python\n","\n","1.

With such an array of tools available, it can be difficult to choose those that are most effective.\n","Thankfully, scientists have been studying the ways people learn for decades and have found some interesting clues about what works and what doesn‚Äôt.\n","\n","### Gamification Encourages Kids to Stay With It.\n","\n","Motivation is a key component of successful learning.¬†Without the proper incentives, students are likely to get bored and abandon a subject¬†long before they‚Äôve become proficient. This is why gamification is now so popular in online and live classrooms.\n","\n","Score-keeping, competition and rewards are great ideas for holding kids‚Äô attention and teaching them everything from algebra to programming in Python.\n","\n","When searching for online Python courses, boot camps and live workshops for your child, look for those that incorporate gamification.\n","\n","### An Easy Introduction Prevents Kids from Feeling Overwhelmed.\n","\n","Some kids might feel like they just don‚Äôt have what it takes to learn Python. The strange combinations of words and punctuation can seem impossible to decipher to a beginner.¬†It‚Äôs easy to feel overwhelmed.¬†But learning the basics of Python isn‚Äôt nearly as difficult as it may appear.\n","\n","The key is to ease into learning by working with small chunks of information at a time. If the information is organized into some highly visual format, that‚Äôs even better.\n","\n","The best coding books for kids are divided into short segments with plenty of pictures and small bits of text.¬†Some coding classes offer short lessons that kids can complete in just a few minutes.¬†These are perfect ways to introduce the Python programming language to young learners.\n","\n","### Project-Based Learning Gets Kids Engaged.\n","\n","Some of the biggest names in technology got started in coding because they wanted to build simple programs for themselves, their friends or their family members.\n","\n","Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates and Steve Jobs are just a few examples of people who got excited about coding by building small but fun and personal projects. Dreaming up a game or website and then figuring out how to build it might be the most effective way to master a programming language.\n","\n","It‚Äôs often necessary to learn most of the basics before beginning, but¬†it‚Äôs easily possible to be proficient enough to build impressive programs in just a couple of weeks.\n","\n","### Practice is a Must.\n","\n","Python programming is just like any other skill in that it requires frequent practice. Kids who regularly use their Python skills to build projects and solve problems will retain their knowledge, while those who don‚Äôt are likely to forget most of what they‚Äôve learned in a very short time. Practice is crucial, so¬†make sure your child has regular opportunities to use Python."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Bonus Question\n","\n","How do we show Zen of Python in command line?"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Further Reading\n","\n","Python is everywhere and it is a very versatile programming language. Even if you only understand the basics, with the help of some libraries and frameworks you‚Äôll be able to accomplish many impressive tasks (and entire projects).\n","\n","The language is used in various fields including web development, data science, machine learning, finance, mathematical computing and cybersecurity. A few cool examples include:\n","\n","* The International Space Station‚Äòs Robonaut 2 robot uses Python for its central command system üöÄ\n","* Netflix uses Python to ensure your movies play without buffering and stopping.\n","* The Nodality company uses Python in its quest to cure cancer.\n","* Disney uses Python for animation.\n","* Activision uses Python to test, analyze and create video games.\n","\n","Many developers choose to use frameworks for their development.
