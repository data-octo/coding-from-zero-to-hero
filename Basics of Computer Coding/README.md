### About Help Your Kids with Computer Coding

Don't just play computer games with your kids-build them! All you need is a desktop or laptop with Adobe 10.2 or later, and an internet connection to download Scratch 2.0 and Python 3. Coding with Scratch can be done without download on [https://scratch.mit.edu](https://scratch.mit.edu).

Help Your Kids with Computer Coding is a straightforward, visual guide to helping kids understand the basics of computer coding using Scratch and Python coding languages. Essential coding concepts like scripts, variables, and strings are explained using build-along projects and games.

Kids can create online games to play like Monkey Mayhem and Bubble Blaster, draw mazes and shapes, build animations, and more using the step-by-step examples to follow and customize. Seven projects let kids-and their parents-practice the skills as they are learning in each section of the book. Kids get instant results, even when completely new to coding.

Packed with visual examples, expert tips, a glossary of key terms, and extras such as profiles of famous coders, Help Your Kids with Computer Coding lays a hands-on foundation for coding so adults and kids can learn together.
