### What is Python
Python is a general-purpose language, which means it can be used to build just about anything, which will be made easy with the right tools/libraries.
Professionally, Python is great for backend web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and scientific computing. Many developers have also used Python to build productivity tools, games, and desktop apps, so there are plenty of resources to help you learn how to do those as well.

### Why Should Kids Learn Python
Python was designed to be easy to understand and fun to use (its name came from Monty Python so a lot of its beginner tutorials reference it). Fun is a great motivator, and since you'll be able to build prototypes and tools quickly with Python, many find coding in Python a satisfying experience. Thus, Python has gained popularity for being a beginner-friendly language, and it has replaced Java as the most popular introductory language at Top U.S. Universities.
##### Easy to Understand
Being a very high level language, Python reads like English, which takes a lot of syntax-learning stress off coding beginners. Python handles a lot of complexity for you, so it is very beginner-friendly in that it allows beginners to focus on learning programming concepts and not have to worry about too much details.
##### Very Flexible
As a dynamically typed language, Python is really flexible. This means there are no hard rules on how to build features, and you'll have more flexibility solving problems using different methods (though the Python philosophy encourages using the obvious way to solve things). Furthermore, Python is also more forgiving of errors, so you'll still be able to compile and run your program until you hit the problematic part.
##### Beginner Friendly.
There are dozens of programming languages, and many of them are good for a wide variety of projects. But Python is unique in that it’s easy to understand, even for a beginner. Some languages use a perplexing combination of symbols and abbreviations. Python doesn’t.
##### Kids Won’t Outgrow Python.
A few programming languages designed for beginners are purely graphical. These are called “block” languages. Scratch is an example of a block programming language. Although Scratch is good for really young learners, it’s easy to outgrow.
That’s not the case with Python, which powers the world’s second-largest search engine: YouTube. Scientists use Python to work with large data sets, and software engineers build neural networks and other forms of artificial intelligence with this versatile language.
##### Top 7 uses

3. Data Extraction 
4. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Data Science Researches 
5. Web Application and Internet Development 
6. Database Easy Access, Interface Customization, and Quick System Integration 
7. Cybersecurity

### How to learn Python

##### What’s the Best Way for Kids to Learn Python?
There are so many different ways for kids to learn programming with Python or any other language. With such an array of tools available, it can be difficult to choose those that are most effective.
Thankfully, scientists have been studying the ways people learn for decades and have found some interesting clues about what works and what doesn’t.

##### Gamification Encourages Kids to Stay With It.
Motivation is a key component of successful learning. Without the proper incentives, students are likely to get bored and abandon a subject long before they’ve become proficient. This is why gamification is now so popular in online and live classrooms.
Score-keeping, competition and rewards are great ideas for holding kids’ attention and teaching them everything from algebra to programming in Python.
When searching for online Python courses, boot camps and live workshops for your child, look for those that incorporate gamification.
##### An Easy Introduction Prevents Kids from Feeling Overwhelmed.
Some kids might feel like they just don’t have what it takes to learn Python. The strange combinations of words and punctuation can seem impossible to decipher to a beginner. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed. But learning the basics of Python isn’t nearly as difficult as it may appear.
The key is to ease into learning by working with small chunks of information at a time. If the information is organized into some highly visual format, that’s even better.
The best coding books for kids are divided into short segments with plenty of pictures and small bits of text. Some coding classes offer short lessons that kids can complete in just a few minutes. These are perfect ways to introduce the Python programming language to young learners.
##### Project-Based Learning Gets Kids Engaged.
Some of the biggest names in technology got started in coding because they wanted to build simple programs for themselves, their friends or their family members.
Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates and Steve Jobs are just a few examples of people who got excited about coding by building small but fun and personal projects. Dreaming up a game or website and then figuring out how to build it might be the most effective way to master a programming language.
It’s often necessary to learn most of the basics before beginning, but it’s easily possible to be proficient enough to build impressive programs in just a couple of weeks.
##### Practice is a Must.
Python programming is just like any other skill in that it requires frequent practice. Kids who regularly use their Python skills to build projects and solve problems will retain their knowledge, while those who don’t are likely to forget most of what they’ve learned in a very short time. Practice is crucial, so make sure your child has regular opportunities to use Python.
