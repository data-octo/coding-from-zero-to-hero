This code is discussed [here][codereview]. If you'd like to have your say about the code, leave an answer there!

## Playing the game

You control the little bird. You can make it climb by pressing <kbd>the up arrow</kbd>, <kbd>Return</kbd>, <kbd>Space</kbd>, or clicking into the window. Don't crash into any pipes! For every pipe you pass without colliding, you get one point.
