    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a modern, robust, high level programming language. It is very easy to pick up even if you are completely new to programming. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python, similar to other languages like matlab or R, is interpreted hence runs slowly compared to C++, Fortran or Java. However writing programs in Python is very quick. Python has a very large collection of libraries for everything from scientific computing to web services. It caters for object oriented and functional programming with module system that allows large and complex applications to be developed in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "These lectures are using jupyter notebooks which mix Python code with documentation. The python notebooks can be run on a webserver or stand-alone on a computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "To give an indication of what Python code looks like, here is a simple bit of code that defines a set $N=\\{1,3,4,5,7\\}$ and calculates the sum of the squared elements of this set: $$\\sum_{i\\in N} i^2=100$$"

    "Python runs on windows, linux, mac and other environments. There are many python distributions available. However the recommended way to install python under Microsoft Windows or Linux is to use the Anaconda distribution available at [https://www.continuum.io/downloads](https://www.continuum.io/downloads). Make sure to get the Python *3.6* version, not 2.7. This distribution comes with the [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/) collection of scientific python tools as well as the iron python notebook. For developing python code without notebooks consider using [spyder](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder) (also included with Anaconda)\n",
    "\n",
    "To open a notebook with anaconda installed, from the terminal run:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ipython notebook\n",

    "Note that for the Monash University optimisation course additional modules relating to the commercial optimisation library [CPLEX](http://www-01.ibm.com/software/commerce/optimization/cplex-optimizer/index.html) and possibly [Gurobi](http://www.gurobi.com/) will be used. These libraries are not available as part of any standard distribution but are available under academic licence. Cplex is included on the [Monash server](https://sci-web17-v01.ocio.monash.edu.au/hub)."
