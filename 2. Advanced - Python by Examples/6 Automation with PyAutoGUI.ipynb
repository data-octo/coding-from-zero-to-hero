    "=====================================\n",

    "\n",
    "PyAutoGUI lets your Python scripts control the mouse and keyboard to automate interactions with other applications. The API is designed to be simple. PyAutoGUI works on Windows, macOS, and Linux, and runs on Python 2 and 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "To install with pip, run ``pip install pyautogui``. See the :doc:`install` page for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "The source code is available on: https://github.com/asweigart/pyautogui\n",
    "\n",
    "PyAutoGUI has several features:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Moving the mouse and clicking in the windows of other applications.\n",
    "* Sending keystrokes to applications (for example, to fill out forms).\n",
    "* Take screenshots, and given an image (for example, of a button or checkbox), and find it on the screen.\n",
    "* Locate an application's window, and move, resize, maximize, minimize, or close it (Windows-only, currently).\n",
    "* Display alert and message boxes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's `a YouTube video of a bot automatically playing the game Sushi Go Round <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfk_T6VKhTE>`_. The bot watches the game's application window and searches for images of sushi orders. When it finds one, it clicks the ingredient buttons to make the sushi. It also clicks the phone in the game to order more ingredients as needed. The bot is completely autonomous and can finish all seven days of the game. This is the kind of automation that PyAutoGUI is capable of.\n",
