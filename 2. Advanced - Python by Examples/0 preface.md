# Python By Examples

This tutorial is to help understand Python coding with hands on examples which cover from basics to game building to web development and to machine learning and deep learning. 

## What you can get

- Basic coding with Python local or online IDE - Basics of programming concept for beginners
- Drawing with Python Turtle and Making simple games with Python PyGame - Advanced learning to understand Object Oriented programing
- Building web application and web scraping - Libraries of Python Flask and Scrapy for experts
- Data analysis, machine learning and deep learning - For understanding of data science and artificial intelligence

## Targeted Audience

- Anyone interested in learning coding
- Young Children interested in basic coding
- Programmers interested in exploring Data Science
- Programmers interested in building AI applications

## Prerequisites

This course is also designed for you if you don't have any computer or programming experience. However, it'll be good if you have a basic understanding of Computer Programming terminologies. A basic understanding of any of the programming languages is a plus.

## The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters
```
Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
```
